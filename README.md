# Notes

An Antimatter plugin for real-time collaborative notes: rich text documents shared with a channel
or kept personal, edited by several people at once.

## Development

```sh
make dist      # build the plugin bundle in dist/
make test      # run the server and webapp tests
make check-style
```

Set `MM_SERVICESETTINGS_ENABLEDEVELOPER=true` to only build the server for the current platform.
